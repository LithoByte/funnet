/**
 This minimal demo gives you the advantages of reusable endpoints while maintaining a focus on Foundation provided classes like URLRequest, URLComponents, and URLSession derivatives. This makes it easy to switch between different hosts and API versions while keeping all the endpoints the same.
 
 To do so, this example makes use of some lightweight extensions on those Foundation classes that make it easier to construct urls (`url(for: String, getParams: [URLQueryItem])`), set json headers (`addHeaders` paired with `jsonHeaders()`), separate call creation from firing (`asConnectable` which is the same as `makeConnectable` but allows non-`Never`error types), and generating server errors for handling.
 
 This mostly vanilla approach has these advantages:
 
 1. It's easy to switch between different hosts and API versions while keeping all the endpoints the same
 2. The logic for setting up a network call and firing it is separate, so entirely different classes can handle those two responsibilities.
 3. Response handling is atomized (through `asConnectable` and `serverErrorPublisher`) so it's easy to have different classes handle different aspects of a server response, eg error handling or json parsing
 
 However, due to constraints from `dataTaskPublisher`, stubbing is not nearly as simple, and firing a call a second time requires resubscribing all listeners to new but identical publishers.
